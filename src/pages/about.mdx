I started my career as a web developer back in 2021 and my job has become my hobby and passion.
Through my design and engineering background, I am a good generalist, always able to look at problems from different angles.

Apart from web development I am interested in the topics __virtual worlds, AI, blockchain, web3__ and many more.

When I am not coding, you can probably catch me riding my gravel bike, reading a book or eating.
