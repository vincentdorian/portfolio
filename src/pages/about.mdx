I got into web development back in 2021, since then my job has become my hobby and passion.
Through my design and engineering background, I am a good generalist, always able to approach problems from different perspectives.

Apart from web development I am interested in the topics __web3, blockchain, virtual worlds and AI.__

I also love doing sports, especially cycling.
