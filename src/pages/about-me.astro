            Now that I think about it, my path in web development was partly already laid in 2014-2016 when I went to August-Bebel-Schule (Offenbach, Germany) a high school with a focus on <italic>media design.</italic>
            Here, I made my first experience with web design and static HTML, however the biggest gain back then was learning about basic design principles and how to apply them.

            After graduating and spending some time abroad, I began studying Advanced Technology at the University of Twente (Enschede, Netherlands) in 2017. 
            This Bachelor of Science program was a mix of interdisciplinary fields, ranging from electrical engineering, advanced mechanics, mechatronics and robotics to technical computer science and systems engineering.
            During my studies I was was tought the fundamentals of Computer Science, basics in hard- and software engineering and writing algorithms using languages like C, C++, Python and Java.
            Back then I was looking forward to a career in the fields of Robotics, which had turnt out to have come differently.

            In 2021 I finished my BSc thesis about virtual agents in Augmented Reality used in primary education.
            This work was an explorative study where I have designed a virtual robot in AR on a mobile device, that should assist children while doing their homework to foster learning motivation.
            I think this way of human computer interaction will play a major role in the future of society and looking at the current emergence of artificial intelligence and its implications.

            All together my educational background has prepared my quite well for all the challenges I am encountering in my daily work.
            Having a design and engineering background also helps me to create user centered products that run reliably and performant.

            After graduating in April 2021, I got my first job at EX-IT, working on three main projects based on Laravel and VueJS.
